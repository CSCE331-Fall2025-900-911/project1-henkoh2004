<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Henny Koh, and I am majoring in Computer Science at Texas A&M University at College Station, 
    Texas. I am from Austin, TX and I love to hang out with my friends during the weekends. One of the projects that 
    I am currently working on integrating AI to support disaster informatics and resilient infrastructure. Through developing 
    analysis algorithms, I am able to collect and process data from multiple sources in order to test systems related to real 
    disaster case studies. </p>

<p>I collaborate with a team of graduate students, which helped me gain experience and insight in technical 
    skills and the interdisciplinary fields of computer science. When working in teams, I would say I naturally gravitate towards a 
    leading and organizing role in the team. I usually take the initiative and start the conversation with my teammates to get to know 
    them first before starting anything else in order to warm up the group environment. From there, I would then share my thoughts of 
    how we could approach the problem or project as a starting point, then ask my group members perspectives on different insights or 
    approaches to the problem. For further information about my background and work, please navigate the different sections of my website.</p>
