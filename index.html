<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Howdy! My name is Henny Koh, and I am in the junior class majoring in Computer Science at Texas A&M University at College Station, 
    Texas. During my free time, I like watching movies, going on runs, socializing with my friends, and work on personal projects.
    One of the projects that I am currently working on integrating AI to support disaster informatics and resilient infrastructure. 
    Through developing analysis algorithms, I am able to collect and process data from multiple sources in order to test systems related to real 
    disaster case studies. </p>

<p>I collaborate with a team of graduate students, which helped me gain experience and insight in technical 
    skills and the interdisciplinary fields of computer science. When working in teams, I would say I naturally gravitate towards a 
    leading and organizing role in the team. I usually take the initiative and start the conversation with my teammates to get to know 
    them first before starting anything else in order to warm up the group environment. From there, I would then share my thoughts of 
    how we could approach the problem or project as a starting point, then ask my group members perspectives on different insights or 
    approaches to the problem. </p>

<p>Something that most motivates me academically is the satisfaction in overcoming a challenging problem. This is why I love mathematics 
    and why I ultimately chose computer science as my major. I really enjoy working on a problem for long periods of time, whether it be 
    a project, homework assignment, leetcode problems, or proofs, and finally reaching a solution. The moment when everything clicks is 
    very rewarding and motivates me to seek out challenges. This is my website, showcasing my work, projects, or extracurricular activities
    that I am involved in. For further information about my background and work, please navigate the different sections of my website.
